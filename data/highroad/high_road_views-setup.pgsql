-- High Road
--
-- This file is a collection of Postgres views that make rendering roads from
-- OpenStreetMap data easier and better-looking. They are broken up by zoom
-- level, corresponding to numbered levels in the traditional web-map spherical
-- mercator projects. Zoom 0 is the entire planet, zoom 10 is where the street
-- details of cities become visible, and zoom 15 is where complex physical road
-- layering such as overpasses and tunnels becomes important.
-- 
-- Taking a cue from Justin O’Bierne’s dearly-departed 41Latitude blog, High
-- Road ensures that each zoom level contains exactly three distinct levels of
-- road: highways, major roads, and minor roads, a simplification of
-- OpenStreetMap’s conventional six-level hierarchy of motorway, trunk, primary,
-- secondary, tertiary, and small local roads.
-- 
-- These three categories are represented by the "kind" attribute, with values
-- of "highway", "major_road", and "minor_road". At the highest zoom levels, a
-- fourth value of "path" appears for footpaths.
-- 
-- 
-- Setup
-- 
-- High Road can be applied to an existing OpenStreetMap rendering database
-- created with osm2pgsql (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql). Using
-- the command-line psql utility, you can add High Road views like this:
-- 
--     psql -U username -f high_roads_views-setup.pgsql databasename
-- 
-- The views here assume that you've created your database using the default
-- settings of osm2pgsql, including the prefix of "copenhagen". If you've chosen
-- a different prefix, you should find every instance of "copenhagen" in the
-- script below and replace is with your chosen prefix.
-- 
--
-- Removal, upgrading
-- 
-- High Road can be removed from an existing OpenStreetMap rendering database. 
--
-- NOTE: To upgrade your OSM planet, it will need to be removed, then setup again.
--
--- Using the command-line psql utility, you can remove High Road views like this:
-- 
--     psql -U username -f high_road_views-remove.pgsql databasename
-- 
-- The views here assume that you've created your database using the default
-- settings of osm2pgsql, including the prefix of "copenhagen". If you've chosen
-- a different prefix, you should find every instance of "copenhagen" in the
-- script below and replace is with your chosen prefix.
--
-- 
-- Rendering
-- 
-- In order to work well with Mapnik, Cascadenik and Carto and make it easy to
-- add road casings that look physically correct, High Road returns multiple
-- copies of each geometry with a "render" attribute.
-- 
-- Render="outline" is used to attach casings around entire classes of roads,
-- and ensures that multiple carriageways and complex interchanges merge cleanly
-- to reduce map noise.
-- 
-- Render="inline" is used for the inner lines of the roads themselves, and
-- represents the road surface.
-- 
-- Render="casing" is present only at zoom level 14 and above, and is used to
-- introduce local outlines to roads that overlap one another. An example use of
-- features with this attribute would be to correctly show overpasses in a
-- complex highway interchange.
-- 
-- 
-- Inclusion
-- 
-- At zoom levels 10 and 11, local and residential streets are omitted. Bold,
-- simple highways dominate the map, and the visual layering is categorical to
-- clearly separate each road type.
-- 
-- At zoom levels 12 and 13, local roads are added for texture but remain
-- separated from highways and arterial roads. Visual layering is by category,
-- with highways appearing in front of everything else.
-- 
-- At zoom level 14, highways remain separate from other roads but the physical
-- layering of on-ramps becomes visible.
-- 
-- At zoom level 15 and above, roads are layered physically using the tunnel,
-- bridge, and layer tags from OpenStreetMap to create correctly-drawn
-- intersections between different types of roads. Footpaths begin to appear
-- at this zoom level as well.
